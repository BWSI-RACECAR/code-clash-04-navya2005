Difficulty Level: 3/10

Prompt: Bill is trying to come up with a name for his RACECAR, but he wants to name his 
car so that there are no duplicate characters in the name. Please write a function that 
returns whether a given string input is a valid name or not. 

Constraints: Inputs will consist of only alphanumeric characters. Lowercase and uppercase
characters are considered different. The length of string will be in the range [0, 100] inclusive.

Test Cases:
Input: “AaBbCc1234”     Output: True 
Input: “Aa123a”         Output: False
Input: “qwer12341”      Output: False
